## 🎨 Who is Pit?

Pit is a curious, cheerful creature who loves solving puzzles and discovering new math tricks. He shows up in tutorials, gives you hints when you're stuck, and cheers you on when you level up.

- 🧠 Loves logic and problem solving  
- 📣 Offers positive feedback and gentle guidance  
- 🎯 Helps highlight key concepts during exercises  
- 🐾 Leaves “footprints” in the tutorial path to track your progress

## ✨ Why a Mascot?

Learning is more fun with a friendly face! Pit adds personality and emotional support to the app — especially for teens who might feel anxious or bored with math.

> “You're not solving problems alone — Pit's always by your side.”
